# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) : London Bike Stands
This is an EDA project at Istanbul Data Science Academy. The purpose of this project is to find a solution to the problem of not being able to rent or drop a bicycle at the stand during rush hours. The data has taken from [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/our-open-data?intcmp=3671#on-this-page-5). 

# Methodology
1. Determine top 15 busiest stations
2. Determine the most used time intervals by weekdays and weekends
3. Decide to transfer among the stands where bicycles are the most picked up and dropped
